## Plan

This clone of Patagonia's Worn Wear site will be built using Angular. It will contain:
* a root module,
* a shopping module, with 4 components
  - Mens
  - Womens
  - Kids
  - Gear
* and a module for the shared components
  - header and
  - footer.
* It will contain a component for the view displayed on the home page.
* a component for retail locations.
* a component for events
* a component for shopping Cart


**Here is my rough plan**
