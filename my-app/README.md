## Build Status

Project is currently in development

## Plan

This clone of Patagonia's Worn Wear site will be built using Angular and contain:
* a root module,
* a shopping module,
* and a module for the shared components - header and footer.
* It will contain components for the views displayed on the home page. These include:
* a component for the hero image and link to shop,
* a component for an image and text grid with links to retail locations, shopping module, and repair guides,
* a component for a text banner, image, and link to events
* a component for a featured story with image and intro text. It will link to Tumblr
* a component for a text banner and images which link to Instagram.

**Here is my rough plan**
